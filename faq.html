  <p>Follow the instructions in the email to create a new password. Use a strong, unique password for security.</p>

  <h2>How do I set up Salesforce Lightning?</h2>
  <p>Salesforce Lightning is enabled from Setup → User Interface → Lightning Experience. Ensure your profile has Lightning access.</p>
  <p>After enabling, you can switch to Lightning from the user menu. Explore features like App Builder and enhanced dashboards.</p>

  <h2>How do I create reports and dashboards?</h2>
  <p>Navigate to the Reports tab, click "New Report," select the object, and configure filters and fields. Save the report.</p>
  <p>For dashboards, use the Dashboard tab to add components based on your reports. Drag and drop charts to visualize data effectively.</p>

  <h2>How can I integrate Salesforce with external apps?</h2>
  <p>Salesforce offers AppExchange for pre-built integrations or you can use REST/SOAP APIs for custom integrations.</p>
  <p>Ensure API permissions are enabled in Setup. Use authentication keys to connect securely with external systems.</p>

  <p>Assign Permission Sets carefully to avoid conflicts and ensure users have access to the necessary objects and fields.</p>

  <h2>How can I import data into Salesforce?</h2>
